        <h2>Crispy Fried Butterfly Pea Flowers are exotic and delicious Thai street food. They’re pretty rare to find but you can easily make them under 30 minutes at home!
        </h2>
        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup tempura flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>0.165 pounds butterfly pea flowers</li>
            <li>1 litre oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour tempura flour, salt and sugar into a mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Add cold water to the bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix with a spoon until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add butterfly pea flowers to the batter.</li>
            <li>Mix the flowers with the batter, making sure that every flower is coated on all sides.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a pan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Once the oil starts to bubble, drop the flowers into the pan, one at a time and about 15-20 flowers per batch.</li>
            <li>Fry for 2-3 minutes. Flip the flowers with a slotted spoon constantly so that every side is equally cooked and doesn’t burn.</li>
            <li>Transfer the flowers to a serving dish with a slotted spoon.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with Thai sweet chili sauce. </li>
        </ol>
