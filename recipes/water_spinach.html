        <h3><strong>WATER SPINACH | MORNING GLORY | PAKBOONG (ผักบุ้ง)</strong></h3>

            <p><strong>Water spinach</strong>, also known as <strong>morning glory</strong> and <strong>pak boong (ผักบุ้ง)</strong> in Thai, is a vegetable that tastes really delicious. Some other good things about this leafy green vegetable are that it's low in calories and rich in vitamins and minerals.
            </p>
            <p><strong> What We've Been Told:</strong> In Thailand, water spinach is normally introduced to children when they're in kindergarten but we make sure to cut it into small pieces so that it's easy for them to eat. Almost every Thai person who went to a Thai school as a kid has been told by their teachers that water spinach is good for their eye health. And it is with this very dish, Stir-Fried Water Spinach or Pad Pak Boong, that they usually get us started on eating water spinach.

        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
            <p>The ingredients we need for this dish are pretty simple. Though some Thais will make it even simpler by using just fish sauce and a tiny bit of sugar to round out the flavor, and that's fine. However, I like to use fermented soybean paste and oyster sauce because my mother has always made this dish with these and I love it. 
            </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 bundle of water spinach, about 12.5 ounces or 350 grams</li>
            <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>4 red Thai chilies </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons of fermented soybean paste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the water spinach by chopping off the roots and first few inches of all the stalks and discard. This part is usually too fibrous and you don't want it in your stir-fry.</li>
            <li>Remove any yellow or bruised leaves and rinse the rest of the stalks with running water. Then, chop them into 3-4 cm pieces (you can do the whole bunch with each cut) and set aside.</li>
            <li>Peel the garlic and remove the stems of the chilies. Roughly pound the garlic, and then the chilies in your mortar with a pestle. Set the mixture aside.</li>
            <li>Set a pan over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and wait for about 1 minute or until the oil is hot.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and chili mixture and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Put the chopped water spinach in the pan and stir for about 2 minutes or until slightly wilted.</li>
            <li>Add the oyster sauce, followed by the fermented soybean paste. Continue to stir to mix all the ingredients until the water spinach turns bright green and more wilted, about 2 minutes. <em>Note that you don't want the water spinach to be completely wilted and dark in color.</em></li>
        </ol>
